I decided to migrate from [zhangguangda.com](https://www.zhangguangda.com/) to here, and move from digital ocean
to this github pages. I feel like I don't really need a web server for these
static contents.
Also I'm considering to restart my blogging. Hope this time I can actually write
some stuff.

Anyway, this is going to be a new start for me.
